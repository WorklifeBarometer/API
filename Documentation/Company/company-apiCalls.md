# Api Calls

**URL** : `/v1.0/company/{companyId}/apicalls`

**Method** : `GET`

**Auth required** : YES

**Note**

The lifetime of a queued request is a follows:
1. Created. `HttpStatusCode` and `HttpStatusReason` will be empty
2. Validated and queued. `HttpStatusCode` will be `202` and `HttpStatusReason` will be `Accepted`. If validation fails, the request will immediately change status to 4xx if it is deemed to be a problem with the data or 5xx if an unexpected problem has happened on the server.
3. Processing started. `HttpStatusCode` will remain `202` and `HttpStatusReason` will change to `Processing...`.  Usually processing will start within a couple of minutes, but if the server is busy it could take up to an hour.
4. Processing completed. `HttpStatusCode` will change to `200` if everything went okay. If not, the code and reason should provide some explanation.
